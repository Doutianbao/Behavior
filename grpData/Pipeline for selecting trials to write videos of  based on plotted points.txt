The idea is to allow the creation of fish swimming video for a trial chosen based on plotted data
points.

Created a function, UnrolledDataFrmGrpData the takes grpData and unrolls all the values in such a way as
to make it writeable to an xl sheet that can read in R.

grpData = 

     mHom: [1x1 struct]
    inter: [1x1 struct]
     vent: [1x1 struct]
	 

	 
Then,
data_xls = UnrolledDataFrmGrpData(grpData);
grpData.data_xls = data_xls;

Saved grpData at
S:\Avinash\Ablations and behavior\GrpData
as
'Ablation data for all groups_20170120T013728.mat'
